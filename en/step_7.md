## Making MazeRobo move

+ Create a new folder \(**Assets &gt; Create &gt; Folder**\) inside the Project Pane "Assets" folder \(you make need to click on this in the **projects** section first\), and call it "Scripts".  
   
+ Create a new C\# script \(**Assets &gt; Create &gt;  C\# Script**\) in this folder and call it "RoboMover".

+ Double-click on "RoboMover" to open it in your editor. In the editor. You should see code like this:

```cs
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class RoboMover : MonoBehaviour {

  // Use this for initialization
  void Start () {

  }

  // Update is called once per frame
  void Update () {

  }
}
```

title: Understanding the code

Let's look at what you've got here. You can ignore the first three lines, for now. They're just the program setting up things it needs. Then you've got

```cs
public class RoboMover : MonoBehaviour {
```

This is the start of a **class** \(a blueprint of code\) called "RoboMover". Don't worry about the `: MonoBehaviour` bit for now. Everything between this first `{` and the last `}` is inside the "RoboMover" class.

Then you have two empty **functions** called "Start" and "Update". Right now, they're exactly the same except for their names, so let's just look at one quickly:

```cs
void Update() {

}
```

A **function** is a set of instructions to do something, wrapped up in a label for the task that makes it easy to remember. For example, for a human, "Make a cup of tea" is a function. We know there are lots of steps to it and, at the end, you have a cup of tea. It would be silly to have to tell someone every step every time you wanted them to make you some tea. The same is true of asking the computer to do something. Much easier to teach it once, in one place, and then get it to do it over and over agin later!

The first word in this **function** declaration is `void`. That means the **function** doesn't **return** anything. That is, it gives nothing back. "Make me a cup of tea" **returns** a cup of tea once all the instructions are done, but "Add milk" doesn't return anything, it just changes the cup of tea that already exists. So "Add milk" would be a `void` function!

Next comes the name of the **function**, that easy label you can use to **call** the function from elsewhere in your code. Notice the brackets `()` beside it though. They're empty now, but they can be used to **pass** information into the function. For example: "Make me a cup of tea \(two sugars\)".

Finally, you have the curly braces `{}`. Everything inside them is the set of instructions the program will follow when the **function** is called. For "Make me a cup of tea" that would be things like:

* Boil water
* Put water in teapot
* Add teabag
* ... and so on

Now that you've got some code to work with, it's time to start adding to it!

+ First, you need to add some **variables**, inside the **class** but before the functions, like this:

```cs
public class RoboMover : MonoBehaviour {

  public float moveSpeed = 4.0f;
  public Rigidbody rb;
  public Transform tf;

  // Use this for initialization
  void Start () {
```

--- collapse ---
---
title: What does the new code do?
---

   These **variables** are labels on values, or things. In this case we've got:

   * `moveSpeed`—a float \(decimal\) number, in this case 4.0
   * `rb`—a variable you'll use to refer to the Rigidbody component
   * `tf`—a variable you'll use to refer to the Transform component

--- /collapse ---

+ You don't actually need the `Start` function in this program, so you can delete these lines:

```cs
// Use this for initialization
void Start () {

}
```

+ Now you need to fill out the `Update` function with this code:

```cs
// Update is called once per frame
void Update () {
  Vector3 desiredDirection = new Vector3 (Input.GetAxis ("Horizontal"), 0.0f, Input.GetAxis ("Vertical"));
  desiredDirection = moveSpeed * desiredDirection;
  desiredDirection = Time.deltaTime * desiredDirection;
  rb.MovePosition (rb.position + desiredDirection);
}
```

--- collapse ---
---
title: What does the new code do?
---

The first line of the function creates `desiredDirection`, which is a  set of three coordinates. Two of them are taken from `Input`, which is the direction the game receives from the player. The last is the depth of the character, which you're not changing so set to 0.  

You then multiply the `desiredDirection` by `moveSpeed`, the variable you set earlier that controls the speed at which MazeRobo moves.  

Next, you multiply it again by `Time.deltaTime` which is the amount of time since the last time `Update` ran. This means the direction changes correctly no matter the type of computer it's on.  

Finally, you change the position of the `rb`, the RigidBody \(which is MazeRobo itself, remember?\), by the amount you've calculated.  

What all this adds up to is moving the character a tiny bit in the direction the player is sending it with the controls, every time the screen is updated.

That should do it! You're close to getting MazeRobo moving now!

+ Back in Unity, drag and drop your RoboMover script from the scripts folder and onto the MazeRobo gameobject in the Hierarchy. You can see that script is now present in MazeRobo’s inspector, under the Rigidbody.

+ There are two empty fields in the RoboMover script—`rb` and `tf`. These stand for Rigidbody and Transform and if you click-and-drag the names of these components from their places in the Inspector and into their respective fields, RoboMover \(the script\) will have all the info it needs to move MazeRobo!

+ Get back into Unity and click on the big ‘Play’ button on the top centre of the Unity interface... **MazeRobo moves!**
