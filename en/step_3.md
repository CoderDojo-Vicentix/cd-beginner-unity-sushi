## Setting the Stage

By following these cards you're going to build a simple video game and learn the tools you can use to make that game bigger and more awesome! You need to do a little setup now, before you get started making your game.

+ Start Unity and choose **New** to create a new project

+ When asked for a name for the project, call it "Beginner Unity Sushi" so it'll be easy to find later!

+ Click "Create Project" and wait for your project to appear on screen!

+ In the top-right corner of the Unity window you'll see a menu called "Layout". Click on it and pick "Default".

+ Now go to the menu bar (at the top of the screen if you're on a Mac, or at the top of the Unity window on a PC) and choose the "Assets" menu near the left. Go to **Create > Folder**, which means pick the "Create" option and then the "Folder" option in the menu that opens underneath. You'll be asked for a name for your new folder. Call it "Scenes".

+ You already have a scene, the game started with one. You just need to save it (**File > Save Scene as...**). You'll need to give the scene a name. Call it "MazeRoboBegins" and put it in the "Scenes" folder you just created (it's inside the "Assets" folder).
