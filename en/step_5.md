## Adding Colour

+ Create a new folder (**Assets > Create > Folder**) and call it "Materials".

+ Now make two **materials** (**Assets > Create > Materials**) called "EyeBlack" and "NoseRed" and drag them into the the "Materials" folder in the "Project" pane at the bottom of the screen.

+ You can set the colour of a material by changing its **albedo** value in the **inspector**. Click on the rectangle next to the dropper icon and a colour picker should open.

+ Make EyeBlack’s albedo value black and NoseRed’s albedo value red.

+ With the Shades object selected, look at the **Mesh Renderer** section of the **inspector** and expand the **Materials** subsection. Click on the small circle to the right of ‘Element 0’ and select EyeBlack. Now we have black shades!

+ Do the same for the Nose object as you did for the Shades object, only now select the NoseRed material. Now we have a red nose!

+ MazeRobo needs a Rigidbody component that we can use to move her about and interact with the physical world. With MazeRobo selected, click on **Component > Physics > Rigidbody**. 

+ You'll see now that when you have MazeRobo selected there's a **Rigidbody** section in the **inspector**. Open up the **Constraints** subsection of the **Rigidbody** section and set **Freeze Rotation X, Y and Z** to **True** by ticking all the boxes. In **Freeze Position**, set **Y** to **True** by ticking that box.

+ Now you have a robot. You can really make it your robot by changing a few colours around, or maybe adding extra pieces to it using more **3DObjects** and moving them around like you did on the last step! Once you're happy with the robot, move on to the next step.
