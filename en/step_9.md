## Camera tracking

MazeRobo moves, but the camera always stays in the same place. That's going to be a problem if you try to add anything outside of the camera's initial field of vision, or anything that moves outside it (like MazeRobo itself!). You can fix it though!

+ Select the **main camera** in the Hierarchy and set the **transform** properties in the **inspector** as follows:

  ![Select MainCamera in the Hierarchy](images/step9_SelectMainCamera.png)

  ### Position
  X: 0
  Y: 9
  Z: -5
  
  ### Rotation
  X: 60
  Y: 0
  Z: 0
    
  ### Scale
  X: 1
  Y: 1
  Z: 1

Now you've changed the camera's angle (run the game to test it if you like!) but it still doesn't follow MazeRobo. 

To make that happen you'll have to update the camera's location every frame and to make that happen, you'll need another **script**.

+ Create a new script (**Assets > Create > C# Script**) and call it `CameraMover`. Put it in the "Scripts" folder.

+ At the start of the script, just inside the "CameraMover" class, add three **variables** like so:

```cs
  public class CameraMover : MonoBehaviour {
    
    public Transform tf;
    public Transform playerTransform;
    public Vector3 distanceBetweenPlayerAndCam;      
```

--- collapse ---

title: What does the new code do?

These track the position of the camera (`tf`), the position of the player/MazeRobo (`playerTransform`) and the distance, in x,y,z terms, from the player to the camera (`distanceBetweenPlayerAndCam`).  

--- /collapse ---

+ Now you need to set the initial distance between the player and the camera as the one you want to keep. Do this inside the `Start` function like so:

```cs
  void Start () {
    distanceBetweenPlayerAndCam = tf.position - playerTransform.position;
  }	
```
  
+ Next, ensure that the game keeps that distance the same in every frame of the game by adding a line to the `Update` function like so:
  
```cs
  void Update () {
    tf.position = playerTransform.position + distanceBetweenPlayerAndCam;
  }
```

+ You need to attach the script to the camera now, so go back to Unity and select the "Main Camera" in the **Hierarchy**. Then drag the script from the **Project** space onto the "Main Camera".

+ Find the "Camera Mover (Script)" in the **Inspector** and drag the "Main Camera" from the **Hierarchy** onto the "Tf" field. Then drag "MazeRobo" from the **Hierarchy** onto the "Player Transform" field.

+ Now run the game and watch the camera follow you around!
