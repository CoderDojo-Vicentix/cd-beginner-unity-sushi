## Give MazeRobo something to play with

Now that you've got your character and it's moving around properly, it's time to give it something to play with! You're going to add a ball for the robot to push around.

+ Start by creating a **Sphere** (**GameObject > 3D Object > Sphere**). Rename it to `Ball`. 

+ Set the **Transform** of Ball so as the position is:
  X: 0
  Y: 1
  Z: 2
 
+ Make another material (see the "Adding colour" card if you don't remember how!) and make it green. Call it BallGreen and drag it onto "Ball"!

If you test the game now and walk MazeRobo into the sphere, you'll notice it behaves just like the wall: It doesn't move. You want this to be a rolling ball, though, so you'll need to give it some rules for moving, like MazeRobo has.

+ Select "Ball" and give it a **Rigidbody** component (**Component > Physics > Rigidbody**).

+ Now try playing!
