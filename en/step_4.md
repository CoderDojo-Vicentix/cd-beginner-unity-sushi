## Making a Robot

+ Now create your first object! Make a **Capsule** object \(**GameObjects &gt; 3D Object &gt; Capsule**\): this will be the body of MazeRobo, your robot!

+ Select the **Capsule** by clicking on it. Look to the right and you should see loads of options and menus. This is called the **Inspector** and it's where you setup most of the objects in your game.

+ You can rename an object by typing a new name in at the top of the inspector. Change the name of the **Capsule** to `MazeRoboBody` now.

+ Next, to be sure that MazeRobo is right at the middle of the game world, look in the **Transform** section of the **Inspector**, click on the cog icon and choose "Reset".

+ You need a couple more objects to make your robot, so create a **Cube** \(**GameObjects &gt; 3D Object &gt; Cube**\) and a **Sphere** \(**GameObjects &gt; 3D Object &gt; Sphere**\).

+ Rename the **Cube** to "Shades" and the **Sphere** to "Nose".

+ Look at the left of the screen. You should see a list of the objects in your game, including "MazeRoboBody", "Shades" and "Nose". Click on "Shades" and drag it onto "MazeRobo". Now drag "Nose" onto "MazeRobo" in the same way.

This puts "Shades" and "Nose" "inside" the "MazeRobo" object, so when they move, they move together. 

This lets you build complex objects \(like a game character!\) from simple ones like **Cubes**, **Spheres**, **Capsules**, etc.

+ Now select "Shades" and look at the **Inspector**'s **Transform** section. You will see a set of three **coordinates**  \(X, Y, Z\) that control the object's **position**. Try changing each of their values to see which direction they control. Try putting a `-` in front of some of the numbers too! Finally, set them to these values:

   X: 0
   Y: 0.64
   Z: 0.42

+ Do the same for "Nose", setting them like this:

    X: 0
    Y: 0.5
    Z: 0.5

+ It doesn't quite look like anything yet, does it? Staying in the **Inspector** look at the **scale** controls. They control the shape of the object. Set "Shades" **scale** to these values:

    X: 0.64
    Y: 0.16
    Z: 0.16

+ Now set "Nose" **scale** to:

    X: 0.16
    Y: 0.16
    Z: 0.16

That's starting to look like a robot! Time to add some colour!
